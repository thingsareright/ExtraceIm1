        id="UnknownId"
        severity="Fatal"
        message="The id &quot;`btGetRegion`&quot; is not defined anywhere. Did you mean btnGetRegion ?"

        priority="8"
        summary="Reference to an unknown id"
        explanation="The `@+id/` syntax refers to an existing id, or creates a new one if it has not already been defined elsewhere. However, this means that if you have a typo in your reference, or if the referred view no longer exists, you do not get a warning since the id will be created on demand. This check catches errors where you have renamed an id without updating all of the references to it."
